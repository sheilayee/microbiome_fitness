# microbiome_fitness

Bacterial species in the gut can exert an effect on different host fitness traits such as development, death, and fecundity. The magnitude of this effect has not yet been resolved, particularly the degree to which individual bacterial species versus microbiome community interactions shape host fitness. One aspect of this study aimed to measure the differential abundances of the 32 possible combinations of the five species of bacteria. The intent of this was to determine the effect that the presence and absence of different bacterial species as well as how the relative abundances of the bacterial species that were present would have on the fruit flyâ€™s fitness phenotype. Another region of interest was if the fitness phenotype of fruit flies with more than one bacterial strain colonizing its microbiome could be predicted using single species and pairwise modeling predictions. The five species of bacteria that were studied were Lactobacillus plantarum (LP), Lactobacillus brevis (LB), Acetobacter pasteurianus (AP), Acetobacter tropicalis (AT), and Acetobacter orientalis (AO). 

This study sought to replicate some of the findings from Gould et al. (2018).

#### figure2.py ####
Replicates Figure 2 from the original paper. Figure 2 sought to understand how lower and higher order microbial interactions affect host fitness. Single species and pairwise modeling predictions used to evaluate higher diversity traits. 

#### figure3.py ####
Replicates Figure 3 from the original paper. The goal of this figure was to determine the mean microbiome (CFUs) for each bacterial species in each of the 32 bacterial combinations.
